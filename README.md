# Developing Status
This project is still in very the early development stage for putting all kinds of charts, Bluetooth libraries, and user interfaces together. 

# Mychart 
mychart is the base station software for HomeICU.

HomeICU device measures the vital signs and sends the measurement data to the base station through Bluetooth (BLE).

The Base Station uses an iPhone/Android phone/iPad to run a GUI app to display the patient's vital sign data on the screen. 

The Base Station can upload the data to the remote cloud server and let the doctor view vital sign measurement and ECG charts over the internet.

## The Hardeware
The sensor board hardware project is hosted at https://github.com/digimint/homeicu.

# Developing Platform

"Mychart" is developed with Flutter and the programming language is Dart. The same copy of source code can support iPhone, iPad, and Android phones.

# Library

The customized code library/packages are listed in "pubspec.yaml" and can be installed from the command line "flutter packages get", and VSCode can install them automatically by extensions, no need to run that command.

- fl_chart : graphic chart display
- charts_flutter : graphic chart display by Google
- shared_preferences : configuration storage 
- flutter_blue : a Bluetooth plugin for Flutter. [Link](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_blue)

# Getting Started with Flutter

## Flutter Install: [link](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos)

> echo $SHELL
> open $HOME/.zshrc
> add the line below:
> export PATH="$PATH:/Users/>a123/Documents/flutter/bin"
> source ~/.zshrc
> flutter doctor
>
> flutter create my_app
> cd my_app 
> flutter run

Notes: Do not delete .git from flutter installation folder.

# Programming Tools
The project needs the "Xcode" for code compiling for iOS, and VSCode for editing. After installing VSCode, you need install extensions: "Awesome flutter Snippets", "Dart", and "Material Icon Theme".

Online tools for generating code for widget:
https://flutterstudio.app

## How to run the code

The program entry point is "lib/main.dart".
Connect the phone to the computer by USB cable
In the command line terminal, type "flutter run" to run the code.

type "hot reload" (press "r" in the console where you ran "flutter run",

Or, "Command+Shift+P" in the VS Code terminal.

# Alternative Solutions

## Processing [Link](https://processing.org) 
An open-source graphical library and IDE for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design,  teach non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context. 

But the app file generated by "Processing" is too large (>250M).

## QT
Qt is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating cross-platform GUI applications that run on platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems.

We gave up on "Qt" because this project does not need a desktop app. 

## Python
Python GUI is easy and cross-platform for desktop, but not a good solution for iOS and Android.
